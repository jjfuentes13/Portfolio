    <section id="bio">
        <p>
            As a versatile software developer with a distinctive blend of 8 years in accounting and 5 years of software development expertise at Infor, I possess a unique understanding 
            of projects' business and technical aspects. My accounting background has enabled me to optimize accounting processes through Excel macros and ensure data consistency across 
            diverse software solutions. By completing a range of courses on Udemy, such as Data Structures and Algorithms, JavaScript, Flutter, Web and Mobile Design UI/UX, Graphic Design, 
            and Adobe Photoshop, I have further enhanced my design and development capabilities and deepened my understanding of UX principles. My participation in frontendmentor.com 
            challenges and real-world projects like the Bellum's attendance app has allowed me to refine and apply the skills acquired through these courses.
        </p>
        <p> I am adept at using Git for version control, consistently completing tasks before sprint deadlines, and collaborating effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders 
            to achieve project success. My current goal is to refine my design and development skills to create user-friendly, high-quality software solutions that address users' needs.

            Throughout my 5-year tenure at Infor, I have played a significant role in various projects, such as developing a reconciliation module and a comprehensive UI overhaul to

            and developing new features, including configurable cube reports with diverse comparison options.

            <h5>An Attendance App</h5>
            <p>
                In response to the challenges a local BJJ gym faces in tracking and promoting students, I designed and developed a custom attendance app, the Bellum Gym Attendance App. 
                The app streamlines the process of tracking student attendance by allowing parents and instructors to check in their children or students for each class easily. 
                The app improves the efficiency of tracking attendance and assists the gym owner and head instructor in monitoring progress and determining when to promote students based 
                on the number of classes attended. Throughout the development process, I collaborated closely with the gym owner and their staff, gathering feedback and iterating on 
                the app's design to create a user-friendly and effective solution. The Bellum Gym Attendance App is now available on the Google Play Store.
